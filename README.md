Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The app that I chose to create was an weight tracker app. I had to make sure that the user was able to login/sign up. I had to make sure that the users were able to add daily weights and goal weights. Had to include a way to notify the user when they reached their goal weight. 

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

A screen that would have the user login or sign up. Another screen would allow the user to put their initall/goal weight on record. Another screen would allow the user to continue to add weights to be able track their progress. Another screen that would allow the user to change their a weight/goal weight. Lastly, the app would be able to send notification to tell the user how much more weight they have to lose in order to reach their goal weight when they had reached their goal weight. I made sure that my app was easy to use and included most everything that was needed for the app to work. Users would be able to do everything easily. It doesn't take a lot of users time to use this app. People are able to easily keep track of their weight without having to do to much.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

I wanted to make sure that the code would accurretly run. I hoped that all the functions would would work according to requiements listed. All I did was try to have all the requirements included in the app. As long as all the requirements were included I am happy with it. I will contine to use this strategy in the future.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

After writing a couple of lins of cade I would test to see if there was any errors. Everything was good up until the end when I got an error that I couldn't fix. It is a little time consuming doing it that way but it works. I want to learn other strategies that I can use in the future. 

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

I wanted my app to look different. I made sure that my background would catch the users attention. I also wanted something that would be easy to use and less time consuming. I believe that I achieved that with my app and hope that I can approve it in the near future.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I believe the layouts for the screens were really successful. I was able to create layouts that incorperated the needed requirements. I believe that screen was easy to navigate and use.
